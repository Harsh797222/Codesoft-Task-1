The To-Do List Application enables users to manage and organize their tasks effectively. Made in command-line interface (CLI) , Here's how this application works :

Create Tasks:

Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
For example, you might input: "Buy groceries," "Finish report," or "Call Mom."
Update Tasks:

Mark tasks as completed or update their status.
You can set priorities, due dates, or additional notes for each task.
Track Progress:

The application displays the list of tasks, making it easy to see what needs to be done.
Completed tasks can be checked off, and pending tasks remain visible.
